# Java-Programming-II--CSC220-
This is a code repo of the various projects I worked on during my time in Java Programming II at the University of Miami. 
In this class, we focused on run time, data structures, and algorithms. 
All of the code was written using Eclipse IDE for Java.

## Running the Code
In order to run or test any of the given code, you can download the prog and run the test files.

## My Favorite Part
As you can see, we have done a vast number of projects. One of my favorite projects was prog05 where we implemented stacks and finally recreated the Tower of Hanoi game.
